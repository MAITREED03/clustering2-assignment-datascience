    "Hierarchical clustering is a type of clustering algorithm that organizes data into a\n",
    "hierarchy of clusters. It builds a tree-like structure, called a dendrogram, where the\n",
    "leaves of the tree represent individual data points, and the branches represent the\n",
    "merging of clusters at different levels. Hierarchical clustering can be classified into\n",
    "two main types: agglomerative and divisive.\n",
    "Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering:\n",
    "● Agglomerative Approach: Starts with each data point as a separate\n",
    "cluster and merges the closest pairs of clusters iteratively until only\n",
    "one cluster (or a predetermined number of clusters) remains.\n",
    "● Dendrogram Interpretation: The dendrogram visually represents the\n",
    "merging process, with each vertical line in the dendrogram indicating a\n",
    "merging event. The height of the vertical lines represents the\n",
    "dissimilarity (or distance) at which clusters merge.\n",
    "Divisive Hierarchical Clustering:\n",
    "● Divisive Approach: Begins with all data points in a single cluster and\n",
    "recursively divides clusters into smaller clusters until each data point is\n",
    "in its own cluster.\n",
    "● Dendrogram Interpretation: The dendrogram also illustrates the\n",
    "division process, showing where the splitting occurs and the\n",
    "dissimilarity at each level.\n",
    "Key Characteristics of Hierarchical Clustering:\n",
    "● Dendrogram Structure: The dendrogram provides a hierarchical representation\n",
    "of clusters, making it easy to interpret the relationships between different\n",
    "levels of clustering.\n",
    "● No Need for Specifying the Number of Clusters in Advance: Hierarchical\n",
    "clustering does not require specifying the number of clusters beforehand. The\n",
    "desired number of clusters can be chosen based on the structure of the\n",
    "dendrogram or by cutting the dendrogram at a certain height.\n",
    "● Cluster Similarity at Different Levels: Unlike partition-based methods such as\n",

    "multiple levels of granularity.\n",
    "Differences from Other Clustering Techniques:\n",
    "Difference from K-means:\n",
    "● K-means is a partition-based clustering algorithm that assigns each\n",
    "data point to a single cluster. In contrast, hierarchical clustering\n",
    "produces a tree-like structure that can represent both fine and coarse\n",
    "levels of clustering.\n",
    "Difference from DBSCAN:\n",
    "● DBSCAN is a density-based clustering algorithm that identifies clusters\n",
    "based on regions of high data point density. Hierarchical clustering, on\n",
    "the other hand, creates a hierarchy of clusters by merging or splitting\n",
    "based on pairwise dissimilarities.\n",
    "Difference from Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM):\n",
    "● GMM is a probabilistic model that assumes data is generated from a\n",
    "mixture of Gaussian distributions. Hierarchical clustering focuses on\n",
    "the arrangement of data points in a hierarchy without explicitly\n",
    "modeling the underlying distribution.\n",
    "Difference from Self-Organizing Maps (SOM):\n",
    "● SOM is a neural network-based clustering method that maps\n",
    "high-dimensional data onto a lower-dimensional grid. Hierarchical\n",
    "clustering constructs a hierarchy based on pairwise distances,\n",
    "providing a different approach to capturing cluster relationships.\n",
    "Difference from Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM):\n",
    "● PAM is a partitioning algorithm that, like K-means, assigns data points\n",
    "to a fixed number of clusters. Hierarchical clustering, in contrast,\n",
    "creates a hierarchy that can be explored at various levels of granularity."

    "method.\n",

    "dendrogram, where the height of the vertical lines represents the\n",
    "dissimilarity at which clusters merge.\n",
    "Divisive Hierarchical Clustering:\n",
    "● Divisive Approach: Divisive hierarchical clustering begins with all data\n",
    "points in a single cluster and recursively divides clusters into smaller\n",
    "clusters until each data point is in its own cluster.\n",
    "● Splitting Criteria: The splitting criteria involve identifying a point or a\n",
    "subset of points that can form a new cluster, and the process is\n",
    "repeated until individual data points become clusters.\n",
    "● Dendrogram Interpretation: Similar to agglomerative clustering, divisive\n",
    "clustering also results in a dendrogram that shows the division of\n",
    "clusters at different levels of dissimilarity.\n",
    "Comparison:\n",
    "● Agglomerative clustering is more commonly used than divisive clustering,\n",
    "partly because agglomerative methods are computationally more efficient.\n",
    "● Agglomerative clustering tends to be more intuitive and easier to implement.\n",
